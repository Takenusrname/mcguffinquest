![RoguelikeDev does the Complete Roguelike Tutorial 2023 image](/event_logo.png)
A yearly event where the community follows the [Python](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/) tutorial but you can decide to do your own thing with different libraries or languages.

For more information on the event check out the official [thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/14kz7al/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/).
